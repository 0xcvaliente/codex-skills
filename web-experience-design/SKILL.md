# Web experience design

Create a visual system that fits the product, then build and inspect the actual experience. Use the smallest route that answers the brief. The user's content, brand, design files, and existing product conventions take precedence over examples and style catalogs.

## Route the work

1. **Product interface:** dashboards, portals, tools, forms, or ongoing workflows. Prioritize task clarity, information hierarchy, states, and accessibility. Read [design direction](references/design-direction.md).
2. **Narrative page:** launch, landing, portfolio, editorial, or campaign. Prioritize the story, evidence, calls to action, and visual rhythm. Read [design direction](references/design-direction.md); read [motion and 3D](references/motion-and-3d.md) only if motion carries part of the story.
3. **Cinematic experience:** scroll choreography, pinned chapters, camera moves, or real-time 3D requested by the user or central to the subject. Read [design direction](references/design-direction.md) and [motion and 3D](references/motion-and-3d.md).

For a scoped repair inside an existing experience, inspect the affected code and use only the relevant reference. Do not restart the page design.

## Shared workflow

- Inspect the repository, brief, content, assets, framework, design system, and current page before choosing a direction. Identify the audience, primary task or action, constraints, and target devices. Ask only when a missing answer changes a hard-to-reverse decision; otherwise state a reasonable assumption and proceed.
- Write a short working direction: page job, content order, visual character, typography roles, color roles, density, imagery, and interaction character. For an existing brand, adapt its tokens and components. Choose styles for their fit; never map an industry or keyword to a predetermined aesthetic.
- Build the smallest representative slice first: the main task flow for an interface, or the opening plus one complete story beat for a narrative page. Inspect it in the browser, correct the direction, then extend the rest.
- Preserve supplied copy and claims unless the user asks to rewrite them. Do not invent testimonials, metrics, certifications, prices, logos, or destinations. Keep semantic content and primary actions available before enhancement.
- Implement within the existing framework and installed stack. Introduce a library, asset, script, or 3D renderer only when it materially improves the requested result. Keep project rules and user choices authoritative.
- Read [verification](references/verification.md) when the result is ready to check. Verify the states and devices that matter for this route; report what was tested and any material limit.

## Decision rules

- Start from content and behavior, then define tokens. A generated palette, font pairing, layout pattern, or visual reference is a candidate to judge against the product; it is not an instruction to apply unchanged.
- Keep a single recognizable visual language across pages and states. Use variation to establish hierarchy or convey a real change, not to accumulate effects.
- Motion needs a job: orient, explain, show cause and effect, or reward an action. Keep reading and control possible while it moves. If motion has no clear job, use a static state.
- Accessibility and resilience are part of the design: keyboard operation, visible focus, readable text and contrast, reflow, reduced motion, loading/error/empty states, and useful content if optional media or a renderer fails.
- Match verification to claims. Static checks can catch code and token defects; they cannot establish visual quality, mobile usability, or that a 3D scene actually works.
