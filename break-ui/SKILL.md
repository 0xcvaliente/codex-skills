# Break UI

Read [Codex adaptation notes](references/codex-notes.md), then the relevant
sections of [the detailed guide](references/guide.md). Keep the requested scope
and existing project conventions. Supporting examples are defaults, not runtime guarantees.

## Workflow

1. Map every rendered field, its boundary, schema limits, optionality, and collection states.
2. Read CATALOG.md; construct plausible worst-case, empty, one-item, and relevant large-list fixtures.
3. Inject fixtures through the component’s real data boundary and expose a dev-only toggle or isolated route.
4. Render the original component at representative sizes and inspect overflow, clipping, wrapping, hierarchy, and performance.
5. Report findings and proposed corrections. Apply and recheck fixes when the user requested them.

## Result

Reviewable fixture controls, actual rendered failures, locations, and scoped corrections or proposals.
