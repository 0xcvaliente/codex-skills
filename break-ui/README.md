# Break UI

Stress-test a component or screen with schema-backed and realistic worst-case data, empty/one/large collections, locales, and missing media. Build dev-only fixtures and report rendered failures; fix them only when requested.

Adapted for Codex from [Emil Kowalski’s skills](https://github.com/emilkowalski/skills),
pinned to [`e8a175de22ae`](https://github.com/emilkowalski/skills/tree/e8a175de22ae1e49370fc144c1f3bb9aeedf988d).

## Workflow

1. Map every rendered field, its boundary, schema limits, optionality, and collection states.
2. Read CATALOG.md; construct plausible worst-case, empty, one-item, and relevant large-list fixtures.
3. Inject fixtures through the component’s real data boundary and expose a dev-only toggle or isolated route.
4. Render the original component at representative sizes and inspect overflow, clipping, wrapping, hierarchy, and performance.
5. Report findings and proposed corrections. Apply and recheck fixes when the user requested them.

## Output

Reviewable fixture controls, actual rendered failures, locations, and scoped corrections or proposals.

## Use

```text
$break-ui stress-test this member list with worst-case data and report layout failures.
```

From a clone of `0xcvaliente/codex-skills`, install the whole package:

```bash
python3 .system/skill-installer/scripts/install-skill-from-github.py \
  --repo 0xcvaliente/codex-skills --path break-ui
```

The collection installer defaults to `$CODEX_HOME/skills` or `~/.codex/skills`.
Use `--dest` for another host, including `--dest ~/.agents/skills` where that is
the configured discovery directory. Preserve local edits before replacing an
existing copy. See the [official skills documentation](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills).

## Codex behavior and requirements

The skill uses existing project tools and available native browser/app/terminal
capabilities. It does not install a runtime by being loaded. Read-only requests
produce findings; requested fixes proceed within their scope. Dependencies and
version-sensitive APIs must match the actual project. Physical-device, release
build, and performance claims require corresponding evidence. Normal automatic
selection is enabled with a scoped description; explicit invocation identifies
the desired workflow.

An audit or review is a report by default. If fixes were requested in the same
request, implement and verify them rather than imposing another permission step.

## Validation and license

From the collection root, with Python and PyYAML:

```bash
python3 .system/skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py break-ui
```
