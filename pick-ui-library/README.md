# Pick UI Library

Choose an appropriate library for a requested frontend capability using Emil Kowalski’s curated shortlist and the project’s existing dependencies. Use for an explicit library choice or recommendation; do not replace working dependencies without a migration request.

Adapted for Codex from [Emil Kowalski’s skills](https://github.com/emilkowalski/skills),
pinned to [`e8a175de22ae`](https://github.com/emilkowalski/skills/tree/e8a175de22ae1e49370fc144c1f3bb9aeedf988d).

## Workflow

1. Identify the requested capability and inspect installed libraries, framework, versions, and constraints.
2. Read the relevant curated category and check the candidate’s current official docs, compatibility, maintenance, and license.
3. Prefer an existing suitable primitive over dependency churn; honor a user-chosen product.
4. Recommend the best fit with the relevant tradeoff. Install/integrate only when part of the task.

## Output

One grounded recommendation or requested integration, with current compatibility evidence.

## Use

```text
$pick-ui-library choose a toast or dialog library for this project, considering what is already installed.
```

From a clone of `0xcvaliente/codex-skills`, install the whole package:

```bash
python3 .system/skill-installer/scripts/install-skill-from-github.py \
  --repo 0xcvaliente/codex-skills --path pick-ui-library
```

The collection installer defaults to `$CODEX_HOME/skills` or `~/.codex/skills`.
Use `--dest` for another host, including `--dest ~/.agents/skills` where that is
the configured discovery directory. Preserve local edits before replacing an
existing copy. See the [official skills documentation](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills).

## Codex behavior and requirements

The skill uses existing project tools and available native browser/app/terminal
capabilities. It does not install a runtime by being loaded. Read-only requests
produce findings; requested fixes proceed within their scope. Dependencies and
version-sensitive APIs must match the actual project. Physical-device, release
build, and performance claims require corresponding evidence. Normal automatic
selection is enabled with a scoped description; explicit invocation identifies
the desired workflow.

## Package contents

- [SKILL.md](SKILL.md): concise Codex routing, workflow, and output.
- [Detailed guide](references/guide.md): the complete working guidance, loaded by relevant section.
- [Codex notes](references/codex-notes.md): scope, tools, versions, input semantics, and verification.
- [Original entrypoint](references/upstream-SKILL.md.source): exact upstream source without nested skill discovery.
- [Source manifest](references/source-manifest.json) and [provenance](references/provenance.md).

## Validation and license

From the collection root, with Python and PyYAML:

```bash
python3 .system/skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py pick-ui-library
```

Structural validation and source hashes do not establish runtime UI quality.
