# Apple Design

Read [Codex adaptation notes](references/codex-notes.md), then the relevant
sections of [the detailed guide](references/guide.md). Keep the requested scope
and existing project conventions. Supporting examples are defaults, not runtime guarantees.

## Workflow

1. Establish the requested platform, design direction, existing components, and accessibility needs.
2. Read the relevant guide sections for continuity, feedback, hierarchy, gestures, typography, materials, or springs.
3. During direct manipulation keep the element attached to the input; transfer release velocity into compatible settling motion.
4. Use platform-appropriate reduced motion and maintain contrast, keyboard access, and understandable navigation.
5. Verify rendered states, interruption, and device behavior; treat platform-derived numeric values as starting points.

## Result

An implementation or scoped critique grounded in the requested direction, with verification and tradeoffs.
