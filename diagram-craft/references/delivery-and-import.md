# Delivery, imports, and exports

| Format | Use | Verify |
|---|---|---|
| Mermaid/chat or `.mmd` | Small engineering explanations or requested source | Syntax in an available renderer; semantic labels |
| `.svg` | Crisp reusable editable vector | Namespace, viewBox, accessible name, resolved styles, preview |
| Single-file `.html` | Companion with alternatives, sources, optional controls | Offline load, narrow layout, fonts, controls |
| `.png` | Raster destination | Dimensions and actual legibility |
| `.pdf` | Print/share | Paper size, clipping, fonts, page count |
| Native editor source | Requested draw.io, Excalidraw, Figma, etc. | Native primitives and tested output |

Keep editable source alongside exports. SVG is editable vector source but is not a native Figma/draw.io document. Do not promise a format the available tools cannot produce and verify.

## Portable SVG

Keep definitions inside SVG and use presentation attributes or embedded SVG styles. HTML CSS inheritance disappears on extraction. Resolve CSS variables and external fonts/assets or disclose dependencies. Avoid `foreignObject` when target support is unknown. Namespace IDs when embedding several diagrams.

The renderer emits explicit colors and a system font stack with no external requests. `extract` handles one inline SVG, restores its namespace, and retains definitions. It does not inline external CSS/images/fonts or choose among several diagrams; use a capable exporter for those cases.

## Redraw imports

Preserve the original. Extract a semantic ledger: IDs, labels, directions, multiplicity, groups, order, guards, meaningful styles. Record uncertain mappings. Compare the redraw against the ledger, including disconnected nodes and exceptions. Geometry can change without topology changing.

- **Mermaid:** inspect syntax and available renderer version. Preserve grammar-specific semantics, subgraphs, parallel edges, implicit nodes, labels, arrow decorations. Render the original when practical. A sequence/ER diagram is not a flowchart.
- **draw.io:** account for pages, layers, groups, IDs, ports, geometry, labels. Payloads may be compressed/encoded; use a capable local decoder/editor. Never execute embedded untrusted content.
- **Excalidraw:** preserve IDs, groups, arrows/bindings, and bound text. Unbound labels may matter; deleted elements must not reappear. Images/freehand annotations may need separate assets or disclosed approximations.
- **Screenshots:** visible geometry establishes appearance, not hidden semantics. Transcribe readable labels, mark uncertain text/direction/cardinality, and ask only when uncertainty changes the answer.

This package does not ship universal import parsers. Use available editors/APIs or proven parsers for nontrivial imports. Disclose preserved, changed, and unresolved items rather than silently dropping unsupported features.

## Browser exports

When Playwright is available:

```bash
node <skill-dir>/scripts/inspect_diagram.cjs diagram.html --out-dir checks \
  --png diagram.png --pdf diagram.pdf --scale 2
```

PNG captures the first SVG at the requested device scale, excluding companion text. PDF prints the full companion on A4 landscape, including notes/sources; it may have several pages. Use a separate layout for a one-page figure or other paper size. Inspect delivered exports.

The helper measures local HTML in Chromium at desktop/mobile widths. It does not install Playwright/browser binaries. Resolve the package through a project installation or the host's bundled `NODE_PATH`; use another browser tool if needed. Install dependencies only within the authorized workflow. Missing tools are a reported limit, not a screenshot claim.

Use `--browser-executable /absolute/path/to/browser` to select an already available compatible Chromium binary when Playwright's default path is missing.

## Preview and publish

Show useful previews and editable-source links. Codex desktop `open_in_codex` shows files/browser URLs but does not inspect or deploy them. Use absolute file links where required by the host.

Hosting/publication/external edits require the requested scope. An offline figure request does not authorize a public site. A named-repository update authorizes that update; do not add analytics or upload private sources elsewhere.

## Verification receipt

State checks actually performed and material limits. For example:

> Checked scene references and route bounds; inspected desktop and 390 px views; compared seven relationships with the supplied design; inspected exported SVG. Deployment region is an assumption. Runtime behavior was not observed.

If an export failed, return working source and explain the specific missing output.
