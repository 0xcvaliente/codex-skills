# Improve Animations

Audit existing motion across a requested codebase or subsystem and produce prioritized, self-contained improvement plans. Use for a motion roadmap; use review-animations for a single diff and animate for a focused implementation.

Adapted for Codex from [Emil Kowalski’s skills](https://github.com/emilkowalski/skills),
pinned to [`e8a175de22ae`](https://github.com/emilkowalski/skills/tree/e8a175de22ae1e49370fc144c1f3bb9aeedf988d).

## Workflow

1. Pin audit scope, interaction frequency, and current motion stack.
2. Read AUDIT.md and inventory actual motion implementations, shared tokens, and repeated defects.
3. Prioritize removal, simplification, responsiveness, interruption, accessibility, and measured performance before decoration.
4. Use PLAN-TEMPLATE.md for actionable plans with paths, observed issues, proposed changes, and acceptance checks.
5. Leave application source unchanged unless implementation was also requested.

## Output

Prioritized findings and implementation plans, distinguishing inspected code, runtime proof, and uncovered areas.

## Use

```text
$improve-animations audit motion in this package and create prioritized implementation plans without changing app code.
```

From a clone of `0xcvaliente/codex-skills`, install the whole package:

```bash
python3 .system/skill-installer/scripts/install-skill-from-github.py \
  --repo 0xcvaliente/codex-skills --path improve-animations
```

The collection installer defaults to `$CODEX_HOME/skills` or `~/.codex/skills`.
Use `--dest` for another host, including `--dest ~/.agents/skills` where that is
the configured discovery directory. Preserve local edits before replacing an
existing copy. See the [official skills documentation](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills).

## Codex behavior and requirements

The skill uses existing project tools and available native browser/app/terminal
capabilities. It does not install a runtime by being loaded. Read-only requests
produce findings; requested fixes proceed within their scope. Dependencies and
version-sensitive APIs must match the actual project. Physical-device, release
build, and performance claims require corresponding evidence. Normal automatic
selection is enabled with a scoped description; explicit invocation identifies
the desired workflow.

An audit or review is a report by default. If fixes were requested in the same
request, implement and verify them rather than imposing another permission step.
