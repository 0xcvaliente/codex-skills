# Animation Vocabulary

Identify the name of a motion effect from a visual or plain-language description, such as rubber-banding, stagger, morph, or origin-aware entry. Use for naming and disambiguation rather than implementing an animation.

Adapted for Codex from [Emil Kowalski’s skills](https://github.com/emilkowalski/skills),
pinned to [`e8a175de22ae`](https://github.com/emilkowalski/skills/tree/e8a175de22ae1e49370fc144c1f3bb9aeedf988d).

## Workflow

1. Read the relevant glossary section and match the observed effect rather than isolated keywords.
2. Lead with the best term and a brief definition; distinguish one or two close alternatives when needed.
3. Label approximate matches and ask for the missing observable detail only when it would change the term.

## Output

The best matching term, a short definition, and useful disambiguation. No unsolicited implementation.

## Use

```text
$animation-vocabulary what is the effect called when a sheet resists a drag past its boundary and snaps back?
```

From a clone of `0xcvaliente/codex-skills`, install the whole package:

```bash
python3 .system/skill-installer/scripts/install-skill-from-github.py \
  --repo 0xcvaliente/codex-skills --path animation-vocabulary
```

The collection installer defaults to `$CODEX_HOME/skills` or `~/.codex/skills`.
Use `--dest` for another host, including `--dest ~/.agents/skills` where that is
the configured discovery directory. Preserve local edits before replacing an
existing copy. See the [official skills documentation](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills).

## Codex behavior and requirements

The skill uses existing project tools and available native browser/app/terminal
capabilities. It does not install a runtime by being loaded. Read-only requests
produce findings; requested fixes proceed within their scope. Dependencies and
version-sensitive APIs must match the actual project. Physical-device, release
build, and performance claims require corresponding evidence. Normal automatic
selection is enabled with a scoped description; explicit invocation identifies
the desired workflow.

## Package contents

- [SKILL.md](SKILL.md): concise Codex routing, workflow, and output.
- [Detailed guide](references/guide.md): the complete working guidance, loaded by relevant section.
- [Codex notes](references/codex-notes.md): scope, tools, versions, input semantics, and verification.
- [Original entrypoint](references/upstream-SKILL.md.source): exact upstream source without nested skill discovery.
- [Source manifest](references/source-manifest.json) and [provenance](references/provenance.md).

## Validation and license

From the collection root, with Python and PyYAML:

```bash
python3 .system/skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py animation-vocabulary
```

Structural validation and source hashes do not establish runtime UI quality.
