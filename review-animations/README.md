# Review Animations

Review a scoped animation diff or component for justified motion, responsiveness, timing, origins, interruption, performance, and accessibility. Return evidence-backed corrections and a calibrated verdict; use improve-animations for a whole-codebase roadmap.

Adapted for Codex from [Emil Kowalski’s skills](https://github.com/emilkowalski/skills),
pinned to [`e8a175de22ae`](https://github.com/emilkowalski/skills/tree/e8a175de22ae1e49370fc144c1f3bb9aeedf988d).

## Workflow

1. Pin files/diff and product frequency; inspect connected triggers and state transitions.
2. Read STANDARDS.md and the guide review/correction hierarchy; check all relevant standards.
3. Remove unjustified motion before polishing its ingredients. Respect intentional project tokens and user requirements.
4. Validate suspected defects with source and playback where possible; distinguish taste preferences from blocking failures.
5. Report before editing unless fixes were requested.

## Output

Before / After / Why findings with file locations, then Block or Approve for the verified scope. Name missing runtime proof.

## Use

```text
$review-animations review this drawer diff for timing, origins, interruptions, and reduced-motion behavior.
```

From a clone of `0xcvaliente/codex-skills`, install the whole package:

```bash
python3 .system/skill-installer/scripts/install-skill-from-github.py \
  --repo 0xcvaliente/codex-skills --path review-animations
```

The collection installer defaults to `$CODEX_HOME/skills` or `~/.codex/skills`.
Use `--dest` for another host, including `--dest ~/.agents/skills` where that is
the configured discovery directory. Preserve local edits before replacing an
existing copy. See the [official skills documentation](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills).

## Codex behavior and requirements

The skill uses existing project tools and available native browser/app/terminal
capabilities. It does not install a runtime by being loaded. Read-only requests
produce findings; requested fixes proceed within their scope. Dependencies and
version-sensitive APIs must match the actual project. Physical-device, release
build, and performance claims require corresponding evidence. Normal automatic
selection is enabled with a scoped description; explicit invocation identifies
the desired workflow.

An audit or review is a report by default. If fixes were requested in the same
request, implement and verify them rather than imposing another permission step.

## Package contents

- [SKILL.md](SKILL.md): concise Codex routing, workflow, and output.
- [Detailed guide](references/guide.md): the complete working guidance, loaded by relevant section.
- [Codex notes](references/codex-notes.md): scope, tools, versions, input semantics, and verification.
- [Original entrypoint](references/upstream-SKILL.md.source): exact upstream source without nested skill discovery.
- [Source manifest](references/source-manifest.json) and [provenance](references/provenance.md).
- [STANDARDS.md](STANDARDS.md).

## Validation and license

From the collection root, with Python and PyYAML:

```bash
python3 .system/skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py review-animations
```

Structural validation and source hashes do not establish runtime UI quality.
