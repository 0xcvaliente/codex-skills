# Ask Sonner

Read [Codex adaptation notes](references/codex-notes.md), then the relevant
sections of [the detailed guide](references/guide.md). Keep the requested scope
and existing project conventions. Supporting examples are defaults, not runtime guarantees.

## Workflow

1. Inspect installed Sonner/framework versions, Toaster ownership, providers, theme, and overlay layering.
2. Read the matching guide/API.md section and verify current version-specific options in official docs when needed.
3. Use the right toast lifecycle and avoid duplicate Toasters or duplicate action/event delivery.
4. Preserve accessible announcements, understandable failure feedback, and the project’s visual tokens.
5. Exercise the actual trigger, loading/success/error transitions, dismissal, dark mode, and modal interactions as relevant.

## Result

A focused integration or fix, with observable lifecycle checks and remaining gaps.

## Supporting resources
