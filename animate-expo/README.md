# Animate Expo

Build or fix React Native and Expo animations, gestures, sheets, screen transitions, and haptics. Use the project’s compatible Reanimated, Gesture Handler, and navigation APIs; use animate for web motion.

Adapted for Codex from [Emil Kowalski’s skills](https://github.com/emilkowalski/skills),
pinned to [`e8a175de22ae`](https://github.com/emilkowalski/skills/tree/e8a175de22ae1e49370fc144c1f3bb9aeedf988d).

## Workflow

1. Inspect Expo SDK, React Native, architecture, Reanimated/Worklets, gesture, and navigation versions before choosing APIs.
2. Name purpose and frequency, then choose compatible native primitives and a UI-runtime motion path for continuous gestures.
3. Read the matching guide/RECIPES.md section; preserve velocity and interruption, reduce motion, and accessible alternatives.
4. Keep per-frame updates out of React state. Add dependencies only when needed and compatible with the existing SDK.
5. Build and check the target platform; distinguish simulator/emulator results from release-build physical-device evidence.

## Output

Native code, relevant build/probe results, and explicit device-only validation gaps.

## Use

```text
$animate-expo add a gesture-driven sheet in this Expo app using its installed SDK and motion stack.
```

From a clone of `0xcvaliente/codex-skills`, install the whole package:

```bash
python3 .system/skill-installer/scripts/install-skill-from-github.py \
  --repo 0xcvaliente/codex-skills --path animate-expo
```

The collection installer defaults to `$CODEX_HOME/skills` or `~/.codex/skills`.
Use `--dest` for another host, including `--dest ~/.agents/skills` where that is
the configured discovery directory. Preserve local edits before replacing an
existing copy. See the [official skills documentation](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills).

## Codex behavior and requirements

The skill uses existing project tools and available native browser/app/terminal
capabilities. It does not install a runtime by being loaded. Read-only requests
produce findings; requested fixes proceed within their scope. Dependencies and
version-sensitive APIs must match the actual project. Physical-device, release
build, and performance claims require corresponding evidence. Normal automatic
selection is enabled with a scoped description; explicit invocation identifies
the desired workflow.

## Validation and license

From the collection root, with Python and PyYAML:

```bash
python3 .system/skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py animate-expo
```

Structural validation and source hashes do not establish runtime UI quality.
