# Sources and adaptation notes

Reviewed: 2026-10-07. Revisions below pin the material actually inspected; source repositories can change. This skill is an original rewritten synthesis of operational ideas, not a verbatim aggregation, an endorsement by the source authors, or a substitute for the books cited in some repositories. No upstream executable scripts, telemetry, installers, API credentials, or proprietary data are bundled.

## Deliberate changes

- One Codex entrypoint with twelve business playbooks and conditional marketing references. Source-pack commands and mandatory stage sequences were replaced by task-driven routing.
- Existing founder and marketing context can be reused without moving files or duplicating facts. Reported, observed, assumed, and proposed information remain distinguishable.
- Simulated panels and model scores are retained only as qualitative hypothesis/review tools. Generated purchase rates are excluded from demand estimates, price validation, and forecasts; they are not treated as real-world upper bounds.
- Arbitrary business verdict totals, universal stage thresholds, promised marketing uplifts, guaranteed launch rankings, and mandatory 90-point editorial scores were replaced by business-specific evidence and decision criteria.
- Cash, recurring revenue, contribution, capacity, acquisition, and attribution have explicit meanings. The original offline helper in `scripts/finance.py` validates inputs and computes only supported arithmetic.
- Attribution credit is separated from causal impact. Fixed-horizon experiments use precommitted stopping rules; patterns are promoted only with observed results and context.
- Provider-specific launch mechanics were rewritten into a platform-neutral implementation and outcome-evaluation workflow. Actual tools, capabilities, credentials, authorization, and current official APIs control execution.
- No source-sponsored tool, telemetry call, scraper, or broad permission assumption is inherited. Draft/build/research authorization does not silently become send/publish/spend/schedule authorization.

## Attribution and licensing

Copyright notices and full upstream license texts are retained in `../licenses/`. The Anthropic source identifies Copyright 2026 Anthropic PBC and Apache-2.0; its adapted workflow is rewritten and generalized in `agent-workflows.md`. All adaptation files were authored for Founder Codex on 2026-10-07. Nothing here claims affiliation with the source authors or the business-book authors. The framework discussions are short original applications, not reproduced book text.

## Maintenance

Refresh only the source or platform details needed for a demonstrated improvement. Keep the pinned revision and adaptation rationale current when changing source-derived guidance. Prefer changes supported by actual usage to copying growing upstream catalogs. Verify finance behavior after arithmetic/schema changes, and evaluate a realistic request after substantial workflow changes.

## Reviewed update — 2026-10-09

Rechecked all eight source repository heads. Six retained their reviewed revision.
Reviewed the Founder source's conventions/changelog and new saved-fact/pricing
regression cases at `0602cad0520e4d8cb165bb1c779d7010cfbc5b45`; retained context
reuse and explicit correction history. Its model-specific evaluation scores are
not claimed for Codex.

Reviewed Marketing Skills at `1efedbc5148b54b2f0f6c6c9fe0be62e151c7fff`, focusing
on A/B testing and sample-size interpretation, analytics, attribution, AI SEO,
content refresh, and sales enablement. Adopted statistical and event-contract
corrections, outcome/credit separation, saved-price continuity, and scoped search
refresh/visibility guidance. This is a selective adaptation review; new paid-ad,
outbound, affiliate, and lead-magnet catalogs were not installed wholesale.
Source licenses remain unchanged.
