# Find Animation Opportunities

Read [Codex adaptation notes](references/codex-notes.md), then the relevant
sections of [the detailed guide](references/guide.md). Keep the requested scope
and existing project conventions. Supporting examples are defaults, not runtime guarantees.

## Workflow

1. Inspect actual states, triggers, frequency, user attention, and current motion.
2. Read the guide’s discovery gates and reject motion with no clear feedback, orientation, or continuity purpose.
3. Recommend a small prioritized set with element, trigger, purpose, properties, timing, and reduced-motion behavior.
4. Name frequent actions and reading surfaces that should remain immediate.

## Result

A scoped opportunity report and deliberate no-animation decisions. No source edits unless requested.
