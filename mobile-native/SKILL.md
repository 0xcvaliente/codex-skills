# Mobile Native Web

Read [Codex adaptation notes](references/codex-notes.md), then the relevant
sections of [the detailed guide](references/guide.md). Keep the requested scope
and existing project conventions. Supporting examples are defaults, not runtime guarantees.

## Workflow

1. Match the reported symptom to the guide and inspect the existing viewport, styles, and support matrix.
2. Apply capability queries, suitable viewport units, safe-area padding, and input/gesture semantics where their rationale applies.
3. Keep zoom and selectable content available. Separate immediate press feedback from action activation.
4. Avoid global scroll/selection suppression on document content and preserve native link behavior.
5. Verify available browser/keyboard states and state which behaviors still require a physical device.

## Result

Focused CSS/meta/interaction fixes with reasons and honest hardware-validation limits.
