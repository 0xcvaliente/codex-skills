# Hatch Pet

`hatch-pet` creates, repairs, validates, and packages animated pets for the Codex v2 spritesheet format. It accepts a character concept, existing art, reference images, or brand cues and carries that identity through generation, deterministic assembly, visual review, and packaging.

This is a substantial production workflow rather than a single image prompt. Generated strips supply the artwork; local scripts provide exact cell geometry, extraction, registration, transparency cleanup, atlas assembly, and review artifacts.

## When to use it

Use it to make a new Codex pet, create a mascot in a non-pixel style, adapt approved art, upgrade an older atlas, or repair an existing v2 pet. Styles can include pixel art, plush, clay, sticker, flat vector, toy-like 3D, or painterly treatments when the character remains readable at pet size.

For a bare company or product name, the workflow first researches visual and personality cues. Concrete mascot descriptions and supplied references normally bypass that discovery stage.

## Format and behavior

The final atlas has **8 columns and 11 rows**, with **192 × 208 pixel cells**, for a total image size of **1536 × 2288 pixels**. Packaging declares `spriteVersionNumber: 2`.

Rows 0–8 contain the standard states: `idle`, `running-right`, `running-left`, `waving`, `jumping`, `failed`, `waiting`, `running`, and `review`. Here `running` represents active task work; directional running rows represent left or right movement.

Rows 9–10 contain sixteen clockwise look directions at 22.5-degree intervals. `000` means up; neutral/front is a separate reference. The intermediate 8 × 9 atlas is used during assembly and is not the final package for a new pet.

## How it works

1. Establish the identity, style, inputs, and working folder; research brand cues only when needed.
2. Generate a canonical base through the installed `imagegen` skill.
3. Generate grounded standard-state row strips and perform incremental checks. An approved right-running row can be mirrored with the dedicated helper when that is safe for the character.
4. Write the look-mechanics plan and establish four cardinal anchors.
5. Generate coherent eight-pose look rows, register them deterministically, and validate their geometry, labeled directions, and continuity.
6. Assemble the extended atlas, perform its defined chroma-cleanup pass, and run deterministic validation.
7. Complete labeled and blind direction review, motion previews, and final visual QA before packaging.

Repair targets the smallest failed row while preserving approved material. The instructions distinguish semantic artwork failures from extraction or geometry failures so deterministic problems do not cause unnecessary regeneration.

## Requirements and output

The workflow requires an installed `imagegen` capability, Codex workspace-dependency access, and the exact bundled Python runtime returned by `load_workspace_dependencies`. The scripts use Pillow. The full workflow also uses lightweight generation and review workers; brand-only discovery needs web search.

Typical outputs include `pet.json`, the transparent extended spritesheet, validation reports, contact sheets, animation previews, direction-semantics results, blind-review records, continuity results, and a final run summary. Generation and review can take substantial time; the instructions' time target is a planning aid rather than a QA shortcut.

Deterministic checks establish geometry and cleanup. They do not replace semantic and motion review, including readable directions, stable identity, real loop variation, and absence of accidental transparent holes.
