# Prototype UI Variants

Build genuinely different UI variants in an isolated prototype route or standalone page with a working picker. Use when the user requests alternatives to compare; promote a selected variant only when selection or integration is authorized.

Adapted for Codex from [Emil Kowalski’s skills](https://github.com/emilkowalski/skills),
pinned to [`e8a175de22ae`](https://github.com/emilkowalski/skills/tree/e8a175de22ae1e49370fc144c1f3bb9aeedf988d).

## Workflow

1. Respect the requested scope; inspect stack, tokens, personality, and surrounding context.
2. Choose distinct named directions on meaningful layout, density, interaction, or motion axes; use the user’s requested count.
3. Read PICKER.md and build a keyboard-accessible comparison harness isolated from production.
4. Verify every variant, realistic states, and picker controls in the browser when available.
5. Present honest tradeoffs and leave selection to the user unless already delegated. Promote and clean up only within that authorization.

## Output

A working picker, distinct alternatives, verified interactions, and the relevant selection/integration state.

## Use

```text
$prototype build three distinct pricing-card variants in an isolated route with a visual picker.
```

From a clone of `0xcvaliente/codex-skills`, install the whole package:

```bash
python3 .system/skill-installer/scripts/install-skill-from-github.py \
  --repo 0xcvaliente/codex-skills --path prototype
```

The collection installer defaults to `$CODEX_HOME/skills` or `~/.codex/skills`.
Use `--dest` for another host, including `--dest ~/.agents/skills` where that is
the configured discovery directory. Preserve local edits before replacing an
existing copy. See the [official skills documentation](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills).

## Codex behavior and requirements

The skill uses existing project tools and available native browser/app/terminal
capabilities. It does not install a runtime by being loaded. Read-only requests
produce findings; requested fixes proceed within their scope. Dependencies and
version-sensitive APIs must match the actual project. Physical-device, release
build, and performance claims require corresponding evidence. Normal automatic
selection is enabled with a scoped description; explicit invocation identifies
the desired workflow.

Exploration stays isolated from production. The user selects a winner unless
selection was already delegated; integration and cleanup preserve requested work.

## Package contents

- [SKILL.md](SKILL.md): concise Codex routing, workflow, and output.
- [Detailed guide](references/guide.md): the complete working guidance, loaded by relevant section.
- [Codex notes](references/codex-notes.md): scope, tools, versions, input semantics, and verification.
- [Original entrypoint](references/upstream-SKILL.md.source): exact upstream source without nested skill discovery.
- [Source manifest](references/source-manifest.json) and [provenance](references/provenance.md).
- [PICKER.md](PICKER.md).

## Validation and license

From the collection root, with Python and PyYAML:

```bash
python3 .system/skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py prototype
```

Structural validation and source hashes do not establish runtime UI quality.
